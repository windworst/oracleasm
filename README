[Oracle Linux ASMLib]

	This package contains the kernel driver for Oracle's generic Linux
ASMLib.  To use this driver, you will also need the support tools and
the actual ASMLib library.  Packages for both are available on the Oracle
Technology Network (http://otn.oracle.com/tech/linux/asmlib/).
	Building the ASMlib requires a quick run of the configure script
in the toplevel directory.  It will try to guess the location of your
kernel.  If you want a specific kernel, see the --with-kernel and
--with-vendorkernel options to the configure script.  This driver only
supports Linux 2.6.  You then can run a make.
	Once built and installed, the support tools will be able to load
the driver and configure ASM storage.
