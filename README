First things first.

!!!! DO NOT RUN THE TESTS WITHOUT CHECKING YOUR DISKS !!!!

	The asmtest and asmtest-multi checks write to the last 10MB or
so of a specified disk.  They take an argument of the disk to write to.
Do not destroy your data.


Second things later.

	Building ASMlib requires a quick run of the configure script
in the toplevel directory.  It will ask the location to the includes for
your kernel.  This code currently only supports Linux 2.6.  You then can
run a make.
	Testing ASMlib is pretty easy.  First, install and mount the
filesystem:

	# mkdir /dev/oracleasm
	# insmod kernel/oracleasm.ko
	# mount -t oracleasmfs oracleasmfs /dev/oracleasm

	Next, you have to mark disks as candidates for ASM.  asmtool is
the tool for this.  It exists in the tools/ subdirectory.  eg:

	# tools/asmtool -m /dev/sdf5

	Now you can then either use 10i or the test programs to try
things out.  Have fun.  Report bugs.


Third things fourth.

	There isn't an easy way to determine the maximum I/O a
particular device can handle dynamically.  The current code takes the
least common denominator and reports the maximum I/O as the maximum of
the smallest card (the MegaRAID).
	Also note that while in good cases the maximum I/O will go out
as one SCSI command, errors can cause it to break up.  These can be
hardware and are not really predictable.  Low memory situations (where a
large scatter/gather list cannot be allocated) also relax this
assurance.  But, if no error occurs on the disk and there is enough
memory, the I/O goes out all together.
