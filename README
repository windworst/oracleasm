First things first.

!!!! DO NOT RUN THE TESTS WITHOUT CHECKING YOUR DISKS !!!!

	The osmtest and osmtest-multi checks write to the last 10MB or
so of /dev/sda.  If the end of /dev/sda is of value to you, you must
change both osmtest.c and osmtest-multi.c to call osm_discover() on a
different disk.  Do not destroy your data.


Second things later.

	Building OSMlib requires a quick run of the Configure script
in the toplevel directory.  It will ask the location to the includes for
your kernel.  This code currently only supports the kernels from Red Hat
Advanced Server 2.1 (2.4.9-e.3+).  So, your path is likely to look like
/usr/src/linux-2.4.9-e.3/include or so.  You then can run a make.
	Testing OSMlib is pretty easy.  First, install and mount the
filesystem:

	# mkdir /dev/osm
	# insmod kernel/osm.o
	# mount -t osmfs osmfs /dev/osm

	Once you have osm mounted, you can then either use 10i or the
test programs to try things out.  Have fun.  Report bugs.
