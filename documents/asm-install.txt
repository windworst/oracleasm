[ Installing ASMLib ]

This document describes the steps required to install the Linux specific
ASM library and its assocated driver.  This library is provide to enable
ASM I/O to Linux disks without the limitations of the standard Unix I/O
API.  The steps below are steps that the system administrator must
follow.

[ Locating the ASMLib Packages ]

The ASMLib software is on the Oracle RDBMS CDs.  Mount CD <insert CD
number here> as /mnt/cdrom.  If your CD-ROM drive is /dev/hdc, you can
mount it with the command:

	mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdc /mnt/cdrom

If you do not have the directory /mnt/cdrom, create it first.

Once you have mounted the CD, change into the ASM software directory.
This is <insert path on CD here>.  You can use the command:

	cd <insert path on CD here>

You now must choose the path for your appropriate Linux distribution and
hardware architecture.  Change into the correct directory:

	cd <insert dist+arch path here>

You will see 4-6 packages in this directory.  The 'asm-lib' package
provides the actual ASM library.  The 'asm-support' package provides the
utilities used to get the ASM driver up and running.  Both of these
packages need to be installed.

The remaining packages provide the kernel driver for the ASM library.
Each package provides the driver for a different kernel.  You must
install the appropriate package for the kernel you are running.  For
example, if you were running Red Hat Advanced Server 2.1, and the kernel
you were using was the 2.4.9-e.27enterprise kernel, you would choose the
asm-2.4.9-e-enterprise package.  So, to installing these packages on Red
Hat Advanced Server 2.1 on an Intel x86 machine, you would use the
command:

	rpm -Uvh osm-support-1.0.0-1.i686.rpm osm-lib-1.0.0-1.i686.rpm osm-2.4.9-e-enterprise-1.0.0-1.i686.rpm

If you were on a different machine, the package names would be slightly
different, replacing 'i686' with the appropriate architecture.

Once the command completes, ASMLib is now installed on the system.

[ Configuring ASMLib ]

Now that the ASMLib software is installed, a few steps have to be taken
by the system administrator to make the ASM driver available.  The
ASM driver needs to be loaded, and the driver filesystem needs to be
mounted.

First, the ASM driver needs to be loaded.  It is loaded via the standard
Linux module loading program, insmod(8).  Load the module with the
command:

	insmod oracleasm

This should load the oracleasm.o driver module.  The ASM driver
filesystem must now be mounted.  This filesystem is not a normal
filesystem.  It only provides the interface for the ASM library to
communicate with the ASM driver.  Mounting the filesystem needs two
options.  The 'uid' and 'gid' options specify the user id and group
id that default to owning the ASM driver access.  If the 'oracle' user
has a user id of 1001, and the 'dba' group has a group id of 1005, the
filesystem is mounted as such:

	mount -o uid=1001,gid=1005 -t oracleasmfs oracleasmfs /dev/oracleasm

The ASM library can now communicate with the ASM driver.

[ Making Disks Available to ASMLib ]

The system administrator has one last task.  Every disk that ASMLib is
going to be accessing needs to be made available.  This is accomplished
via two things.  The permissions of the disk device file must be such
that the database user or group ('oracle' and 'dba', in the above
example) can read the device file.  This can often be accomplished via
adding the database user to the 'disk' group or changing the ownership
of the disk device file to the database group.  To change the
group ownership of the SCSI disk /dev/sdg:

	chgrp dba /dev/sdg
	chmod g+r /dev/sdg

Finally, the disk must be 'marked' as an ASM disk.  The tool asmtool(8)
is used to mark the disk.  The '-m' option marks a disk, the '-u' option
unmarks a disk, and the '-c' option checks to see if a disk is marked.
To mark the disks /dev/sdg and /dev/sdh as ASM disks, use the command:

	asmtool -m /dev/sdg /dev/sdh

The ASM instance will now be able to load ASMLib and see the disks
/dev/sdg and /dev/sdh to access them via the library.
